Though it may seem dainty, it can be used to carry anunimaginably large amount of energy.  If connected to one's arms, then one will lose all feeling in them.  And all strength in one's legs will dissipate if such joints are connected tothem.  Connect this joint to one's skull...  Ah, hatred, pain, madness, pride \u2014 none of these will be washed away.
