{"id": "i_n113071", "name": "Talisman of the Enigmatic Land", "rarity": 4, "description": "A talisman that somehow appeared in your inventory after you passed theWayward Hermetic Spiritspeaker's test.  In some records kept by the Masters of the Night-Wind, priests masterful inSpiritspeaking can use meditation to pass their consciousness through thelight and shadow that reflects off obsidian, thus reaching the enigmaticunderground realm that only the dead may enter. This deed is, however,perilous, and priests who perform it must often wear such talismans to guardtheir souls from being lost in that mysterious land. However, this talisman'ssymbolic value far outstrips its real effects. Perhaps the hermit-priest whogrants this to a warrior who passes the test only does so as a simpleblessing.", "material_type": "ElementalStone", "weekdays": []}
