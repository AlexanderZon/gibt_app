Apart fromwisdom and power, she also brought mercy and joy to her people.  Just as the earth needs more than the burning sunshine and pouring rain, tothe people of the Lord of Flowers, joy and love, singing and music, and wineand extravagance were just as vital as strength and sensibility.  It is said that flowers blossom so that they may enjoy a spectacular death,and that death was precisely the wholehearted pursuit of the Lord of Flowers \u2014for death adds bitterness to lost joy, and intensifies with time acrossendless memories.  The ignorant Lord of Deserts was never aware of her reasoning. He only reveledin her immense charm and grace \u2014 and as misguided as such fervent affectionsmight be, they were well within the calculations of the Lord of Flowers.", "material_type": "PrimaryAscensionMaterial,", "weekdays": ["Tuesday", "Friday", "Sunday"]}
