Chiyo, a warrior of the oni tribe with the Electro Mitsudomoe emblememblazoned on her back, was once swallowed whole by a beast from beyond thisworld that had a tiger's body and a serpent's tail while holding back theforces of darkness. At last, she tore the creature's innards apart fromwithin, breaking free.  This is the origin of the phrase \"Chiyo the Tiger-Bite,\" and would be changedover many years to \"Torachiyo.\"  But within the belly of the beast, she was stained by a deep sin and saw hercomrades ripped to shreds by those blood-red teeth. Steeped in darkness as faras the eye could see, she would eventually draw her sword upon the AlmightyNarukami Ogosho. Her sword-arm and one horn would be cloven, and she wouldflee from the city into the forest like a wounded beast. There, they say thatshe was taken for some unknown monster and slain by the tengu, or perhaps bythe Shuumatsuban \u2014 or perhaps by a scion of the Iwakura Clan training deep inthe mountains, for her features had been twisted by hatred and the agony ofher wounds. Or perhaps she even met the oni-masked, sword-bearing doll nearthe corpse of the giant serpent, and there ended her life's journey.  Few among those who fought against the abyss in those days were spared pitch-dark dreams. Those who slew monsters and then became them were hardly theminority. The border between worlds grows fragile, and corruption of this kindis perhaps not merely monodirectional.", "material_type": "PrimaryAscensionMaterial,", "weekdays": ["Wednesday", "Saturday", "Sunday"]}
