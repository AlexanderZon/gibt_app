{"id": "i_213", "name": "Dew of Repudiation", "rarity": 4, "description": "A strange water droplet left behind by the collapse of the Hydro Hypostasis.  It has strong rejection properties, and this forms the basis of one of theHydro Hypostasis' attack patterns as well. They say that water containsmemories and willpower, and that these things can grow when bodies of watermeld together. However, the waves conjured by the Hydro Hypostasis areincompatible with the currents that flow above and below ground. Even if itwere to flow into the surpassingly pure waters of Petrichor, this drop ofwater will likely resist assimilation as strongly as mercury.", "material_type": "ElementalStone", "weekdays": []}
