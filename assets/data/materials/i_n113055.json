Its actual weight far exceeds what would be expected given its size.  Everything gathers around heavy objects, just as gold attracts more than iron,or the ground more than in the breeze blowing above. Just as light cannotescape from the vortex of darkness, cause and effect is attached to fate,perhaps irreversibly so.", "material_type": "BossItem", "weekdays": []}
