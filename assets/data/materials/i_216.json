Although it looks like a fin of some kind, it does not actually have anyfunction at all.  The people of Byakuyakoku once investigated the Bathysmal Vishaps quitedeeply. Their most distinctive feature was the ability to choose what traitsit wished to pass on to its offspring. Because of their great hatred for man-made light sources, these vishaps will lose any visual acuity by the time theyreach maturity.
